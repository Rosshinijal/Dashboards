Project Description
Overview Heart disease remains one of the most significant health challenges globally, accounting for a substantial number of deaths each year. Early detection and prevention can significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce mortality rates. This project focuses on analyzing heart disease data to understand the key factors that contribute to heart disease and to develop predictive models that can accurately identify individuals at risk.

Objectives Data Exploration and Cleaning: Understand the dataset's structure, clean any inconsistencies, and prepare the data for analysis. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform detailed EDA to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights within the data. Feature Engineering: Create new features that may improve the predictive power of our models. Model Building: Develop and train several machine learning models to predict the presence of heart disease. Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of each model using various evaluation metrics. Results Interpretation: Interpret the results to draw meaningful conclusions and provide actionable insights for healthcare professionals. Dataset The dataset used for this project is the Heart Disease Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes 14 attributes:

here is the dashboard of Heart Disease Analysis

Age: Age of the patient. Sex: Gender of the patient (1 = male, 0 = female). Chest Pain Type (cp): Type of chest pain experienced by the patient. 0: Typical angina 1: Atypical angina 2: Non-anginal pain 3: Asymptomatic Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps): Resting blood pressure in mm Hg. Serum Cholesterol (chol): Serum cholesterol level in mg/dl. Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs): Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false). Resting Electrocardiographic Results (restecg): Resting ECG results. 0: Normal 1: Having ST-T wave abnormality 2: Showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalach): Maximum heart rate achieved. Exercise Induced Angina (exang): Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no). ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest (oldpeak): ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest. Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment (slope): 0: Upsloping 1: Flat 2: Downsloping Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy (ca): Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy. Thalassemia (thal): 0: Normal 1: Fixed defect 2: Reversible defect Methodology Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Handle missing values and outliers. Encode categorical variables. Normalize or scale numerical features if necessary. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Generate statistical summaries. Create visualizations to understand distributions and relationships. Identify key features correlated with heart disease. Feature Engineering:

Create interaction terms or polynomial features. Apply dimensionality reduction techniques if needed. Model Building:

Train multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, and k-NN. Use techniques like cross-validation to optimize model performance. Model Evaluation:

Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Compare performance across models and select the best-performing model. Results and Insights:

Summarize the findings and performance of the models. Provide actionable insights based on the analysis. Conclusion This project aims to contribute to the ongoing efforts to improve heart disease detection and prevention through data science. By leveraging machine learning and thorough data analysis, we can better understand the factors leading to heart disease and develop tools that aid in early diagnosis, ultimately saving lives.
